# TODO LIST MANAGER



## TODO LIST  v1.0

I have written a TODO list automation program to manage my schedule more efficiently, as I have a lot of things to do these days.

Features

- Automatic indexing: If you use the text as is, you need to manually update all the index numbers if you insert or delete anything in the middle. However, it is easier to automate it.
- Reordering: The order of tasks can be changed according to the importance of the tasks.
- Exception handling: It is not a perfect exception handling, but I have handled exceptions such as the range of numbers.



## TODO LIST v2.0

Change Logs

- Content modification added.
- Bug fix for index over 10.
